# Loan Default Prediction

My loan default prediction project uses machine learning to estimate the likelihood that a borrower will fail to repay a loan by training a model on historical loan and customer data. This helps banks assess credit risk and make smarter lending decisions, reducing financial losses and improving efficiency.

## Project Purpose
The goal is to help banks make better lending decisions by identifying high-risk borrowers.
