# 🏦 Loan Default Prediction

## About The Project
This project uses machine learning to predict the likelihood that a borrower will default on a loan. By training on historical customer data (income, loan amount, credit history), the model helps banks assess credit risk before approving loans.

## Why This Project?
Banks need smarter lending decisions to:
- Reduce financial losses from defaults
- Approve qualified customers faster
- Improve overall lending efficiency
